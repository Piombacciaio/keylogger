# keylogger
a simple keylogger I made just for fun. 
obviously it's for educational purposes only.

# brief explaination
this logger will append to a list every key once it gets released.

once that the timer gets to 0, if any key has been released it will create a log file or send it to your email address.

the name "svchost" is not casual, as on windows any process called svchost.exe will get a system icon in the process manager.

This is nothing fancy or overengineered, and may be used only to troll your friends and most of the antiviruses will detect it
